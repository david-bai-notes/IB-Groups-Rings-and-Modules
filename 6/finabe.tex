\section{The Classification of Finite Abelian Groups}
We will prove (the generalization of) the following theorem later when we look at modules:
\begin{theorem}\label{classify_fin_abe}
    Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a product of cyclic groups.
\end{theorem}
In this section, we shall look at the uniqueness criterion of this statement.
In fact, this representation is not unique in general, but we can get some sort of a uniqueness statement.
\begin{lemma}
    If $m,n$ are coprime, then $C_m\times C_n\cong C_{mn}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $g_m$ be the generator of $C_m$ and $g_n$ be that of $C_n$, then $(g_m,g_n)\in C_m\times C_n$ has order $\gcd(m,n)=mn$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
    Let $G$ be a finite abelian group, then $G\cong C_{n_1}\times C_{n_2}\times\cdots\times C_{n_k}$ such that any $n_i$ is a prime power
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Let $n$ be a positive integer, then $n=p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_r^{e_r}$ where $p_i$ are distinct primes, then
    $$C_n\cong C_{p_1^{e_1}}\times \cdots\times C_{p_r^{e_r}}$$
    by the preceding lemma.
    Combining this with the theorem gives the result.
\end{proof}
In fact, what we will prove is the following refinement of Theorem \ref{classify_fin_abe}.
\begin{theorem}\label{fin_abe_struct}
    Let $G$ be a finite abelian group, then $G\cong C_{d_1}\times C_{d_2}\times\cdots\times C_{d_t}$ such that $1<d_1|d_2|d_3|\cdots|d_{t-1}|d_t$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
    The integers $n_1,n_2,\ldots$ are up to a reordering, and $d_1,d_2,\ldots$ are uniquely determined by the group $G$.
    The proof (which we omit) works by counting the elements of $G$ with every possible order (it is enough to consider prime powers though).
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
    1. Abelian groups of order $8$ can only be $C_8,C_2\times C_4,C_2\times C_2\times C_2$.\\
    2. Abelian groups of order $12$ can only be $C_2\times C_2\times C_3\cong C_2\times C_6,C_4\times C_3\cong C_{12}$
\end{example}
